# Week 1: Introduction to AI and Its Role in Information Professions

This week introduces artificial intelligence (AI) from an information-science perspective.  
The emphasis is on conceptual understanding rather than technical detail: what AI is, how it has developed over time, and how it already shapes everyday information practices and professional work.

## 1. What Is Artificial Intelligence?

Artificial intelligence does not have a single, universally agreed-upon definition. In general, AI refers to **computer systems designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence**, such as learning from experience, recognizing patterns, making decisions, or processing natural language.

Common misconceptions about AI include:
- AI is equivalent to human intelligence
- AI systems truly “understand” meaning in the same way humans do
- AI is always autonomous, intentional, or self-aware

In practice, most AI systems are **narrow and task-specific**. They operate within defined goals, data sources, and constraints, and their behavior is shaped by design choices made by humans.

## 2. A Brief History of AI

AI has evolved through several major paradigms, each reflecting different assumptions about how intelligence can be modeled or simulated.

### Symbolic AI
Early AI research focused on **rules, logic, and explicit knowledge representation**. Systems were built using:
- If–then rules
- Logical reasoning
- Expert systems
- Ontologies and taxonomies

These approaches work well in structured domains but struggle with ambiguity, uncertainty, and scale.

### Machine Learning (Subsymbolic AI)
Later approaches shifted toward **learning patterns from data rather than encoding rules directly**. Key characteristics include:
- Statistical models trained on examples
- Performance that improves with more data
- Reduced reliance on human-crafted rules

This paradigm enabled advances in areas such as speech recognition, image classification, and recommendation systems.

### Generative AI
More recent systems focus on **generating new content**, including text, images, and code. Large language models (LLMs) are a prominent example. These systems:
- Learn from massive collections of existing content
- Generate outputs based on probability and patterns
- Interact with users through natural language

Each paradigm reflects different strengths, limitations, and assumptions about intelligence.

## 3. Well-Known Milestones and Breakthroughs

Certain developments are often highlighted in popular and professional discussions of AI:
- The **Turing Test**, as a thought experiment about machine intelligence
- **Expert systems** used in fields like medicine and engineering
- The rise of **neural networks** and deep learning
- The emergence of **large language models** capable of writing, summarizing, and translating text

These milestones are important not only for technical reasons, but also because they influence how society understands and trusts AI systems.

## 4. Everyday AI

AI is embedded in many routine information activities, often without being labeled as such. Examples include:
- Search engines and ranking algorithms
- Recommendation systems for media, shopping, and news
- Autocomplete, predictive text, and spelling correction
- Translation tools and conversational assistants

These systems shape what information is visible, how quickly it can be accessed, and how choices are presented to users.

## 5. AI in Information Professions

In libraries, archives, and other information organizations, AI is increasingly used to support:
- Discovery systems and search interfaces
- Metadata creation and cataloging automation
- Knowledge organization and classification
- User analytics and service optimization

Rather than replacing professionals, these systems often **reconfigure workflows**, redistribute labor, and raise new questions about transparency, accountability, and professional judgment.

Understanding how AI functions in these contexts is an essential part of contemporary information literacy.
