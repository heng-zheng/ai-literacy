# Everyday AI

AI has been integrated into society for decades.
In earlier stages, these systems were rarely labeled as “AI,” but were introduced through their practical functions.

Examples of early AI applications include:

- Rule-based expert systems (e.g., medical decision support)
- Search and information retrieval systems
- Email spam filtering and text classification
- Recommendation systems (books, movies, products)
- Speech and handwriting recognition

In the era of generative AI, AI technologies are everywhere:

- [AI in Google search](https://search.google/ai-in-search/), [ChatGPT search](https://openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/):
    - AI Overviews provide quick summaries of key information. Summaries include links to external web sources for further exploration
    - Support multimodal interaction with users, enabling them to search with text, voice, images, and visual context.
- Video platforms such as YouTube use personalized recommendation systems and [generative AI features](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14110396?hl=en) that allow users to ask questions about videos.
- Writing assistant tools, such as Grammarly, can help non-native speakers identify and correct grammatical issues.
- [AI-powered chatbots](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/ai-customer-service-chatbots) for customer support and FAQs. 
- Generative AI models can create videos from text prompts, such as [OpenAI's Sora](https://openai.com/index/video-generation-models-as-world-simulators/).
