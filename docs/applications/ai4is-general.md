# AI in Information Professions

## AI as Library Practice

AI contributes to core library and information tasks, including:

- Linked data for metadata and knowledge organization:  
    - linked data work by OCLC ([OCLC Linked Data](https://www.oclc.org/en/linked-data.html))
- Search and discovery systems:  
    - Ex Libris Primo with the [Research Assistant feature](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/020Primo_VE/Primo_VE_(English)/015_Getting_Started_with_Primo_Research_Assistant).  
    - Campus-wide example: University of Kentucky [InfoKat Discovery]((https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY)) with Research Assistant enabled.

## AI as Information System Infrastructure

AI functions as core infrastructure within many information systems. In organizational settings, AI is widely used in the following areas:

- AI interface for internal information systems
    - Example: Microsoft 365 Copilot for organizations, used by many institutions, including campus-wide deployment at the University of Kentucky (see UK's [AI offerings](https://its.uky.edu/ai-offerings))  
    - Enterprise-level AI assistants often include data protection and privacy safeguards. For example, [enterprise data protection in Microsoft Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/enterprise-data-protection)


- Customer support and service automation  
    - Overview: [Automating call centers with AI](https://cacm.acm.org/news/automating-call-centers-with-ai/)  
    - Example: Salesforce Agentforce AI agents ([Agentforce AI agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/))

- AI introduces new challenges for cybersecurity:
