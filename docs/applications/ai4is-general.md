# AI in Information Professions

## AI as Library Practice

AI contributes to core library and information tasks:

- Classification, metadata, and knowledge organization  
    - Example: linked data work by OCLC ([OCLC Linked Data](https://www.oclc.org/en/linked-data.html))

- Search, discovery, and reference  
    - Example: library discovery systems such as Ex Libris Primo, including the [Research Assistant feature](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/020Primo_VE/Primo_VE_(English)/015_Getting_Started_with_Primo_Research_Assistant))  
    - Campus-wide example: University of Kentucky InfoKat Discovery with Research Assistant enabled ([UKY InfoKat Discovery](https://saalck-uky.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?vid=01SAA_UKY:UKY))

## AI as Information System Infrastructure

Beyond front-facing tools, AI functions as core infrastructure within many information systems.

Common examples include:
- Search engines that retrieve and rank information
- Content moderation systems that filter or flag text, images, or videos

In organizational settings, AI is widely used in the following areas:

- Enterprise knowledge bases for internal information access. 
Examples: Microsoft 365 Copilot ([overview](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/11/18/microsoft-ignite-2025-copilot-and-agents-built-to-power-the-frontier-firm/), [Copilot for organizations](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/organizations)). 
Enterprise-level AI assistants often include data protection and privacy safeguards (Example: [Enterprise data protection in Microsoft Copilot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/copilot/microsoft-365/enterprise-data-protection))

- Customer support and service automation  
    - Examples:  
        - Overview of AI use in call centers: [Automating call centers with AI](https://cacm.acm.org/news/automating-call-centers-with-ai/)  
        - Example platform: [Salesforce Agentforce AI agents](https://www.salesforce.com/agentforce/ai-agents/)

- Analytics and reporting platforms for identifying patterns and trends in data  
    - Examples:  
        - [Microsoft Power BI](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/products/power-bi/)  
        - [Google Looker](https://cloud.google.com/looker)

AI also introduces new challenges for cybersecurity:
